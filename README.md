This repo uses various supervised learning algorithms to predict PCOS diagnosis based on clinical data (Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasoonkottarathil/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos)
The code is written in Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanation for replication and learning purposes.
