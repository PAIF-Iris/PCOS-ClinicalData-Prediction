This repo uses various supervised learning algorithms to predict PCOS diagnosis based on clinical data (Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasoonkottarathil/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos)

The code is written in Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanation for replication and learning purposes. 

The stackedML notebook is a recreation of this research: https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics13081506. Since no code was provided, I assumed certain model parameters and manipulated them to increase accuracy. This model is consistent with that of the research paper, where stacked machine learning models achieved higher accuacy than any independent ML algorithms. 

Overview:

Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Machine Learning (ML)
    - Supervised Learning → Regression, ✔️Classification
    - Unsupervised Learning → Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Association Rule Learning
    - Semi-Supervised Learning → Label Propagation
    - Reinforcement Learning → Q-Learning, Policy Gradient
- Deep Learning (DL)
    - ANN
    - CNN (images)
    - RNN / LSTM (sequences)
    - Transformers (text, vision)
    - Autoencoders
    - GANs
    - GNN
    - Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN, A3C)
